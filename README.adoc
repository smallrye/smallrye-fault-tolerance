== SmallRye Fault Tolerance

SmallRye Fault Tolerance is an implementation of {microprofile-fault-tolerance}[Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance].

=== Integration

==== Thread pools
A vendor may want to provide custom executor services for the fault tolerant executions.
This can be achieved by creating a custom `io.smallrye.faulttolerance.ExecutorFactory` and
registering it via `ServiceLoader`.

If multiple factories are discovered, the one with the *highest* priority is used.

==== Context Propagation
`smallrye-fault-tolerance-context-propagation` provides an integration with MicroProfile Context Propagation.
It is done by providing a custom `ExecutorFactory`, namely `ContextPropagationExecutorFactory`.

Please note that if you override the executor factory with a custom one and would like the context propagation
to be enabled, you have to make sure your executor factory creates the executor services in the right way.

==== Open Tracing
SmallRye Fault Tolerance enables trace propagation to the asynchronous invocations via MicroProfile
Context Propagation. To enable it, add `smallrye-fault-tolerance-tracing-propagation` to your project

=== Configuration
SmallRye Fault Tolerance supports all the configuration options of MicroProfile Fault Tolerance
and, additionally, the following options:

- `io.smallrye.faulttolerance.mainThreadPoolSize`: the number of threads used by the fault tolerance mechanisms.
This does not include bulkhead thread pools.
Defaults to `100`.

Older configuration properties that should no longer be used:

- `io.smallrye.faulttolerance.globalThreadPoolSize`: deprecated; use `mainThreadPoolSize` instead.
If `mainThreadPoolSize` isn't set, this is still used as a fallback.

- `io.smallrye.faulttolerance.timeoutExecutorThreads`: ignored.
Was previously used to set size of a dedicated thread pool for timeout watchers.
No longer used, because timeout watchers are now executed on the main thread pool.

=== Instructions

Compile and install this project:
[source,bash]
----
mvn clean install
----

This will run all the tests and the TCK.

==== Project structure

* link:api[] - SmallRye Fault Tolerance API, additional to the Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance API.
Treated as a public API.
* link:implementation/core[] - Implementation of core fault tolerance strategies.
Independent of the Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance API or the SmallRye Fault Tolerance API.
Treated as private API, no compatibility guaranteed.
* link:implementation/fault-tolerance[] - Implementation of the Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance API and the SmallRye Fault Tolerance API.
* link:implementation/context-propagation[] - Optional integration with MicroProfile Context Propagation.
* link:implementation/tracing-propagation[] - Optional integration between MicroProfile OpenTracing and MicroProfile Context Propagation.
Technically doesn't even belong into SmallRye Fault Tolerance.
* link:testsuite/basic[] - Basic test suite.
Some parts of it overlap with the Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance TCK.
* link:testsuite/integration[] - Context propagation integration test suite.
* link:testsuite/tck[] - Runs the implementation against the Eclipse MicroProfile Fault Tolerance TCK.
* link:docs[] - Project documentation.
