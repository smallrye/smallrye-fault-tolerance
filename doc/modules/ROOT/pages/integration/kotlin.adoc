= Kotlin Integration Concerns

This page describes integration concerns for xref:usage/extra.adoc#kotlin-suspend-functions[Kotlin `suspend` functions].

To enable support of Kotlin suspending functions, it is required that the support library is present.
Its coordinates are: `io.smallrye:smallrye-fault-tolerance-kotlin`.

This library includes some service providers that {smallrye-fault-tolerance} will automatically load and use.
Therefore, no more integration is necessary.
