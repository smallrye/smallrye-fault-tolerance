= OpenTracing

{smallrye-fault-tolerance} includes an integration between MicroProfile Context Propagation and OpenTracing.
That is, {smallrye-fault-tolerance} includes an implementation of `ThreadContextProvider` which propagates the active OpenTracing span from one thread to another.
This can be used when xref:integration/context-propagation.adoc[Context Propagation] is enabled.

This integration is present in the `io.smallrye:smallrye-fault-tolerance-tracing-propagation` artifact.
It is used automatically when xref:integration/context-propagation.adoc[Context Propagation] is present.
When Context Propagation is not present, this artifact can still be in place, it just won't do anything.

Technically, this doesn't even belong to {smallrye-fault-tolerance}, but it's present for historical reasons.
