= Programmatic API Integration Concerns

This page describes integration concerns of the xref:usage/programmatic-api.adoc[Programmatic API] of {smallrye-fault-tolerance}.

== Standalone Implementation

The standalone implementation provides no integration points.
It is, as the name suggests, completely standalone.

At the moment, it is not possible to change the thread pool to which actions are offloaded.
A single cached thread pool, obtained using `Executors.newCachedThreadPool()`, is used for all thread offloads.

Users of the standalone implementation that also use an event loop based library, such as Vert.x, may integrate the event loop support as described in xref:integration/event-loop.adoc[Event Loop].

== CDI implementation

The CDI implementation will use the thread pool an integrator provides (see xref:integration/thread-pool.adoc[Thread Pool]).
This also extends to the context propagation integration (see xref:integration/context-propagation.adoc[Context Propagation]).

It will also use the event loop support, if integrator provides one (see xref:integration/event-loop.adoc[Event Loop]).

In other words, runtimes that use the CDI implementation don't have to do any extra integration work.
The existing integration is enough.
