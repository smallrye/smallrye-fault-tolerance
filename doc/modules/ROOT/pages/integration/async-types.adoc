= Additional Asynchronous Types Integration Concerns

This page describes integration concerns for xref:usage/extra.adoc#async-types[Additional Asynchronous Types].

To enable support of additional asynchronous types, it is required that the support library is present.
That is:

* https://smallrye.io/smallrye-mutiny/[Mutiny]: `io.smallrye:smallrye-fault-tolerance-mutiny`
* https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/3.x[RxJava 3]: `io.smallrye:smallrye-fault-tolerance-rxjava3`

These libraries include some service providers that {smallrye-fault-tolerance} will automatically load and use.
Therefore, no more integration is necessary.
