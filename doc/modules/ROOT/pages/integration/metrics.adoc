= Metrics

{smallrye-fault-tolerance} provides support for MicroProfile Metrics, OpenTelemetry and Micrometer.
Alternatively, metrics may be completely disabled at the integration level.

As usual, this integration is based on CDI.
{smallrye-fault-tolerance} includes an internal interface `MetricsProvider` and these implementations:

* `io.smallrye.faulttolerance.metrics.MicroProfileMetricsProvider`
* `io.smallrye.faulttolerance.metrics.OpenTelemetryProvider`
* `io.smallrye.faulttolerance.metrics.MicrometerProvider`
* `io.smallrye.faulttolerance.metrics.NoopProvider`

There are 2 possible ways how to integrate metrics:

* exactly 1 class from the list above is a bean;
* more than 1 class from the list above is a bean, in which case, `io.smallrye.faulttolerance.metrics.CompoundMetricsProvider` must also be a bean.

NOTE: Only the _names_ of the classes listed above are treated as public.
That is, the classes should be treated as opaque, no guarantees about their internals are made.

== Default Integration

In case the integrator uses the CDI Portable Extension `FaultToleranceExtension` and lets the container create an instance, metrics presence is discovered automatically.
All present metrics systems are used.

== Using a `FaultToleranceExtension` Constructor

In case the integrator uses the CDI Portable Extension `FaultToleranceExtension` and creates its instance manually, they can use a constructor.

In addition to a zero-parameter constructor, which is used in the default integration as described above, there are constructors that take a parameter of `MetricsIntegration` or `Set<MetricsIntegration>`.

`MetricsIntegration` is an enum with these values:

* `MICROPROFILE_METRICS`: use MicroProfile Metrics integration
* `OPENTELEMETRY`: use OpenTelemetry (MicroProfile Telemetry) integration
* `MICROMETER`: use Micrometer integration
* `NOOP`: no metrics

== Metrics Providers

Metrics providers have additional requirements, as described below.

=== MicroProfile Metrics

If MicroProfile Metrics should be used, the integrator must ensure that the following artifacts are present:

* `org.eclipse.microprofile.metrics:microprofile-metrics-api`;
* some implementation of MicroProfile Metrics.

=== OpenTelemetry

If OpenTelemetry should be used, the integrator must ensure that the following artifact is present:

* `io.opentelemetry:opentelemetry-api`.

Further, a bean of type `io.opentelemetry.api.metrics.Meter` must exist.
This bean is used to emit the actual metrics.

=== Micrometer

If Micrometer should be used, the integrator must ensure that the following artifact is present:

* `io.micrometer:micrometer-core`.

Further, a bean of type `io.micrometer.core.instrument.MeterRegistry` must exist.
This bean is used to emit the actual metrics.

=== Noop

If the "noop" provider is used, metrics are completely disabled.

No metrics API and implementation is required in this case.
