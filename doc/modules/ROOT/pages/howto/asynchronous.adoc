= How to Guard Asynchronous Methods

{smallrye-fault-tolerance} allows offloading method calls to another thread, as well as applying asynchronous fault tolerance.

Asynchronous fault tolerance means guarding not just the synchronous method execution, but the entire asynchronous operation started by the method call, until the result is delivered.
For example:

[source,java]
----
CompletionStage<String> doSomething() {
    return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        if (someCondition) {
            return someValue;
        } else {
            throw someException;
        }
    });
}
----

This method always returns a `CompletionStage` and it never throws an exception.
However, if `someCondition` does not hold, the `CompletionStage` returned from the method will complete exceptionally.

Ordinary (non-asynchronous) fault tolerance:

* never considers this operation failing, because the method returns a value and does not throw an exception;
* considers this operation finished when the method returns.

Asynchronous fault tolerance, on the other hand:

* defers its decision process to the moment when the returned `CompletionStage` completes,
* and considers this operation running until that happens.

As a special case, if an asynchronous method in fact does throw an exception (it typically shouldn't), it is treated as if it returned a `CompletionStage` that is already completed exceptionally with the thrown exception.

== `@Asynchronous`

A method that returns `java.util.concurrent.Future` or `java.util.concurrent.CompletionStage` may be annotated `@Asynchronous`.
Such method is executed on another thread.
Additionally, if the return type is `CompletionStage`, asynchronous fault tolerance applies.

[NOTE]
====
Note that if an `@Asynchronous` method returns a `Future`, asynchronous fault tolerance does _not_ apply.
Only the synchronous method execution is guarded.

Asynchronous fault tolerance only applies if the `@Asynchronous` method returns `CompletionStage`.
====

Use `@Asynchronous` if the method has blocking logic, but you donâ€™t want to block the caller thread.
For example:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyService {
    @Retry
    @Asynchronous // <1>
    CompletionStage<String> hello() {
        ... blocking IO here ...
    }
}
----

<1> Using the `@Asynchronous` annotation, because the method blocks, and it is necessary to offload its execution to another thread.

== `@AsynchronousNonBlocking`

include::partial$srye-feature.adoc[]

A method that returns `CompletionStage` may be annotated `@AsynchronousNonBlocking`.
In such case, the method is executed on the original thread, but asynchronous fault tolerance still applies.

Use `@AsynchronousNonBlocking` if the method _does not_ have blocking logic, and you want the execution to stay on the caller thread.
For example:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MyService {
    @Retry
    @AsynchronousNonBlocking // <1>
    CompletionStage<String> hello() {
        ... non-blocking IO here ...
    }
}
----

<1> Using the `@AsynchronousNonBlocking` annotation, because the method does not block and offloading execution to another thread is not necessary.

=== Non-compatible mode

include::partial$non-compat.adoc[]

In the non-compatible mode, the `@AsynchronousNonBlocking` annotation is not necessary.
A method that returns `CompletionStage` and is not annotated `@Asynchronous` is automatically treated as `@AsynchronousNonBlocking`.
