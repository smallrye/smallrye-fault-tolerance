= Programmatic API

include::partial$srye-feature.adoc[]

In addition to the declarative, annotation-based API of {microprofile-fault-tolerance}, {smallrye-fault-tolerance} also offers a programmatic API for advanced scenarios.
This API is present in the `io.smallrye:smallrye-fault-tolerance-api` artifact, just like all other additional APIs {smallrye-fault-tolerance} provides.

== Installation

If you use {smallrye-fault-tolerance} as part of a runtime that implements {microprofile-fault-tolerance}, you don't have to do anything.
The programmatic API is ready to use.
In this documentation, we'll call this the _CDI implementation_ of the programmatic API, because it's integrated with the {microprofile-fault-tolerance} implementation, which is naturally based on CDI.

.Quarkus
****
In Quarkus, the {smallrye-fault-tolerance} API is brought in automatically, as a transitive dependency of the Quarkus extension for {smallrye-fault-tolerance}.
That is, you don't need to do anything to be able to use the programmatic API.
****

.WildFly
****
In WildFly, the {smallrye-fault-tolerance} API is not readily available to deployments.
If you want to use it, you need to add a module dependency to the deployment using `jboss-deployment-structure.xml`.

Note that at the time of this writing, the {smallrye-fault-tolerance} module in WildFly is considered private.
If you do add a module dependency on it, to be able to use the {smallrye-fault-tolerance} API, you may be stepping out of the WildFly support scope.
****

In addition to the CDI implementation, {smallrye-fault-tolerance} also offers a _standalone implementation_ that is meant to be used outside of any runtime.
This implementation does not need CDI or anything else.
If you want to use {smallrye-fault-tolerance} in a standalone fashion, just add a dependency on `io.smallrye:smallrye-fault-tolerance-standalone`.
The API is brought in transitively.

== Usage

The entrypoints to the programmatic API are the `Guard` and `TypedGuard` interfaces.

These interfaces represent a configured set of fault tolerance strategies.
Their configuration, order of application and behavior in general corresponds to the declarative API, so if you know that, you'll feel right at home.
If not, the javadoc has all the information you need (though it often points to the annotation-based API for more information).

The interfaces are very similar, there are only 2 differences:

. `Guard` requires specifying the return type of the guarded operation for each `call()` or `get()` (or `adapt*`) method call.
  `TypedGuard`, on the other hand, requires specifying the return type once, when creating an instance using `create()`.
  Therefore, `Guard` may be used for guarding many different types, while `TypedGuard` may only be used to guard single type.
. `TypedGuard` allows defining a fallback.
  `Guard` does not.

In the following text, we'll only talk about `Guard`, but it also applies to `TypedGuard` without a change (except of the differences mentioned above).

To create an instance of `Guard`, you can use the `create` static method.
It returns a builder which has to be used to add and configure all the fault tolerance strategies that should apply.
There is no external configuration, so all configuration properties have to be set explicitly, using the builder methods.
If you don't set a configuration property, it will default to the same value the annotation-based API uses.

.Disabling Fault Tolerance
****
There's one exception to the "no external configuration" rule.

The CDI implementation looks for the well-known `MP_Fault_Tolerance_NonFallback_Enabled` configuration property in MicroProfile Config.
The standalone implementation looks for a system property with the same name, or obtains the value from custom configuration (as xref:integration/programmatic-api.adoc[described] in the integration section).

If such property exists and is set to `false`, only the fallback and thread offload fault tolerance strategies will be applied.
Everything else will be ignored.

Note that this is somewhat different to the declarative, annotation-based API, where only fallback is retained and the `@Asynchronous` strategy is skipped as well.
Since this significantly changes execution semantics, the programmatic API will apply thread offload even if fault tolerance is disabled.

Similarly to the declarative API, implementations of the programmatic API also read this property only once, when the `Guard` API is first used.
It is _not_ read again later.
****

Let's take a look at a simple example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyService {
    private static final Guard GUARD = Guard.create()
        .withRetry().maxRetries(3).done()
        .build();

    public String hello() throws Exception {
        return GUARD.call(() -> externalService.hello(), String.class); // <1>
    }
}
----

<1> Here, we call `externalService.hello()` and guard the call with the previously configured set of fault tolerance strategies.
    The `call` method used here takes the `Callable` type, which represent the guarded action.
    The `get` method works just like `call`, but accepts a `Supplier`.

The previous example shows how to apply fault tolerance to synchronous actions.
{smallrye-fault-tolerance} naturally also supports guarding asynchronous actions, using the `CompletionStage` type.
Unlike the declarative API, the programmatic API doesn't support asynchronous actions that return the `Future` type.

[source,java]
----
public class MyService {
    private static final Guard GUARD = Guard.create()
        .withBulkhead().done()
        .withThreadOffload(true) // <1>
        .build();

    public CompletionStage<String> hello() throws Exception {
        return GUARD.call(() -> externalService.hello(),
                new TypeLiteral<CompletionStage<String>>() {}); // <2>
    }
}
----

<1> The thread offload here only applies to asynchronous actions.
    If you use the same `GUARD` to guard a synchronous action, no thread offload will apply.
<2> Note that here, we use the `TypeLiteral` class (from CDI) to specify the type of the guarded action.

Asynchronous actions may be blocking or non-blocking.
In the example above, we assume the `externalService.hello()` call is blocking, so we set thread offload to `true`.
{smallrye-fault-tolerance} will automatically move the actual execution of the action to another thread.

If we didn't configure `withThreadOffload`, however, the execution of an asynchronous action would continue on the original thread.
This is often desired for non-blocking actions, which are very common in modern reactive architectures.

Also note that in this example, we configured multiple fault tolerance strategies: bulkhead and thread offload.
When that happens, the fault tolerance strategies are ordered according to the {microprofile-fault-tolerance} specification, just like in the declarative API.
Order of all the `with*` method invocations doesnâ€™t matter.

=== Single-Action Usage

The `Guard` API is general and permits guarding multiple different actions using the same set of fault tolerance strategies.
Often, we need to guard just a single action, although possibly several times.

For such use case, the `Guard` instance may be adapted to a `Callable<T>` or `Supplier<T>` using the `adapt*` methods:

[source,java]
----
public class MyService {
    private static final Callable<String> guard = Guard.create()
        .withTimeout().duration(5, ChronoUnit.SECONDS).done()
        .build() // <1>
        .adaptCallable(() -> externalService.hello(), String.class); // <2>

    public String hello() throws Exception {
        return callable.call(); // <3>
    }

}
----

<1> Create a `Guard` object that can guard arbitrary actions.
<2> Adapt the general `Guard` instance to a `Callable` that guards the `externalService.hello()` invocation.
    Similar method exists that accepts and returns a `Supplier`: `adaptSupplier`.
<3> You can do whatever you wish with the adapted `Callable`.
    Here, we just call it once, which isn't very interesting, but it could possibly be called multiple times, passed to other methods etc.

=== Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

The `Guard` and `TypedGuard` interfaces both decide whether the guarded action is synchronous or asynchronous based on the action type.
This is given to `Guard` when calling or adapting the action, and to `TypedGuard` when creating it.

If the type is asynchronous (such as `CompletionStage`), the asynchronous behavior will also be guarded; the action is only considered complete when the `CompletionStage` actually completes.
If the type is not asynchronous, only the synchronous behavior will be guarded; the action is considered complete when the method returns.

==== Mutiny Support

It is enough to include the Mutiny support library `io.smallrye:smallrye-fault-tolerance-mutiny`, as described in xref:reference/asynchronous.adoc#async-types[Additional Asynchronous Types].
With this library present, both `Guard` and `TypedGuard` will recognize `Uni` as an asynchronous type and guard it properly.
Guarding a `Multi` is not supported.

For example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyService {
    private final Supplier<Uni<String>> GUARD = TypedGuard.create(
            new TypeLiteral<Uni<String>>() {})
        .withTimeout().duration(5, ChronoUnit.SECONDS).done()
        .withFallback().handler(() -> Uni.createFrom().item("fallback")).done()
        .build()
        .adaptSupplier(() -> externalService.hello()); // <1>

    public Uni<String> hello() {
        return guard.get();
    }
}
----

<1> The call to `externalService.hello()` is supposed to return `Uni<String>`.

Note that the `Uni` type is lazy, so the action itself won't execute until the guarded `Uni` is subscribed to.

.Quarkus
****
In Quarkus, the Mutiny support library is present by default.
You can guard `Uni`-returning actions out of the box.
****

=== Stateful Fault Tolerance Strategies

The bulkhead, circuit breaker and rate limit strategies are stateful.
That is, they hold some state required for their correct functioning, such as the number of current executions for bulkhead, the rolling window of successes/failures for circuit breaker, or the time window for rate limit.
If you use these strategies, you have to consider their lifecycle.

The {smallrye-fault-tolerance} programmatic API makes such reasoning pretty straightforward.
Each `Guard` object has its own instance of each fault tolerance strategy, including the stateful strategies.
If you use a single `Guard` object for guarding multiple different actions, all those actions will be guarded by the same bulkhead, circuit breaker and/or rate limit.
If, on the other hand, you use different `Guard` objects for guarding different actions, each action will be guarded by its own bulkhead, circuit breaker and/or rate limit.

If you call the `adapt*` methods on the same `Guard` multiple times, the resulting `Callable` or `Supplier` objects will guard the underlying action using the original `Guard` instance, so stateful strategies will be shared.

=== Circuit Breaker Maintenance

The `CircuitBreakerMaintenance` API, accessed through `CircuitBreakerMaintenance.get()` or by injection in the CDI implementation, can be used to manipulate all named circuit breakers.
A circuit breaker is given a name by calling `withCircuitBreaker().name("\...")` on the fault tolerance builder, or using the `@CircuitBreakerName` annotation in the declarative API.

Additionally, `CircuitBreakerMaintenance.resetAll()` will also reset all unnamed circuit breakers declared using the `@CicruitBreaker` annotation.
For this to work, all unnamed circuit breakers have to be remembered.
This is safe in case of the declarative, annotation-based API, because the number of such declared circuit breakers is fixed.
At the same time, this would _not_ be safe to do for all unnamed circuit breakers created using the programmatic API, as their number is potentially unbounded.
(In other words, remembering all unnamed circuit breakers created using the programmatic API would easily lead to a memory leak.)

Therefore, all circuit breakers created using the programmatic API must be given a name when `CircuitBreakerMaintenance` is supposed to affect them.
Note that duplicate names are not permitted and lead to an error, so lifecycle of the circuit breaker must be carefully considered.

=== Event Listeners

The programmatic API has one feature that the declarative API doesn't have: ability to observe certain events.
For example, when configuring a circuit breaker, it is possible to register a callback for circuit breaker state changes or for a situation when an open circuit breaker prevents an invocation.
When configuring a timeout, it is possible to register a callback for when the invocation times out, etc. etc.
For example:

[source,java]
----
private static final Guard GUARD = Guard.create()
    .withTimeout().duration(5, ChronoUnit.SECONDS).onTimeout(() -> ...).done() // <1>
    .build();
----

<1> The `onTimeout` method takes a `Runnable` that will later be executed whenever an invocation guarded by `GUARD` times out.

All event listeners registered like this must run quickly and must not throw exceptions.

== Configuration

As mentioned above, with the single exception of `MP_Fault_Tolerance_NonFallback_Enabled`, there is no support for external configuration of fault tolerance strategies.
This may change in the future, though possibly only in the CDI implementation.

== Metrics

The programmatic API is integrated with metrics.
All metrics, as described xref:reference/metrics.adoc[in the Metrics reference guide] and the linked guides, are supported.
The only difference is the value of the `method` tag.
With the programmatic API, the `method` tag will be set to the _description_ of the guarded operation, provided on the `Guard` builder.

[source,java]
----
private static final Guard GUARD = Guard.create()
    .withDescription("hello") // <1>
    .withRetry().maxRetries(3).done()
    .build();
----

<1> A description of `hello` is set, it will be used as a value of the `method` tag in all metrics.

It is possible to create multiple `Guard` objects with the same description.
In this case, it won't be possible to distinguish the different `Guard` objects in metrics; their values will be aggregated.

If no description is provided, a random UUID is used.

== Differences to the Specification

`Guard` and `TypedGuard` have the following differences to standard MicroProfile Fault Tolerance:

* asynchronous actions of type `java.util.concurrent.Future` are not supported;
* the fallback, circuit breaker and retry strategies always inspect the cause chain of exceptions, following the behavior of SmallRye Fault Tolerance in the non-compatible mode.

== Kotlin `suspend` Functions

The `Guard` and `TypedGuard` APIs do not support Kotlin `suspend` functions at the moment.

== Integration Concerns

Integration concerns, which are particularly interesting for users of the standalone implementation, are xref:integration/programmatic-api.adoc[described] in the integration section.

[[migration_from_faulttolerance]]
== Migration from `FaultTolerance`

The 1st version of the programmatic API had the `FaultTolerance` interface.
This is deprecated and scheduled for removal in {smallrye-fault-tolerance} 7.0.
The replacement are the `Guard` and `TypedGuard` types.

When migrating, one first has to decide which type to use as a replacement.
The `TypedGuard` is much closer to the `FaultTolerance` type, so that is the easiest way to migrate.
There are some differences still:

- the `create()` static method now takes a parameter that expresses the guarded action type, either as a `Class` or as a `TypeLiteral`;
- there are no `cast()` and `castAsync()` methods, because `TypedGuard` only guards actions of a single type;
- there is no support for guarding or adapting ``Runnable``s, only ``Callable``s and ``Supplier``s are supported.
  As a replacement for `Runnable`, a `Supplier<Void>` (or `Supplier<CompletionStage<Void>>` etc.) can be used.

For example, these usages of `FaultTolerance`:

[source,java]
----
static final FaultTolerance<String> FT1 = FaultTolerance.<String>create()
    .withDescription("ft1")
    .withRetry().maxRetries(3).done()
    .withFallback().handler(() -> "fallback").done()
    .build();

static final FaultTolerance<CompletionStage<String>> FT2 = FaultTolerance.<String>createAsync()
    .withDescription("ft2")
    .withBulkhead().limit(5).queueSize(100).done()
    .withTimeout().duration(3, ChronoUnit.SECONDS).done()
    .build();
----

can be rewritten to:

[source,java]
----
static final TypedGuard<String> GUARD1 = TypedGuard.create(String.class)
        .withDescription("ft1")
        .withRetry().maxRetries(3).done()
        .withFallback().handler(() -> "fallback").done()
        .build();

static final TypedGuard<CompletionStage<String>> GUARD2 = TypedGuard.create(
                new TypeLiteral<CompletionStage<String>>() {})
        .withDescription("ft2")
        .withBulkhead().limit(5).queueSize(100).done()
        .withTimeout().duration(3, ChronoUnit.SECONDS).done()
        .build();
----

After creating a `TypedGuard`, there's no change in how it's used.
The methods `call()`, `get()`, `adaptCallable()` and `adaptSupplier()` have the same signatures as before.

`TypedGuard` is the only possible replacement if you need fallback.
If you don't need fallback, and especially if you need to guard actions of multiple types, `Guard` is a better choice.

The differences are:

- `Guard` has no type parameter (is not generic) and does not allow defining fallback;
- there are no `cast()` and `castAsync()` methods, because they are no longer needed;
- there is no support for guarding or adapting ``Runnable``s, only ``Callable``s and ``Supplier``s are supported.
  As a replacement for `Runnable`, a `Supplier<Void>` (or `Supplier<CompletionStage<Void>>` etc.) can be used.

For example, these usages of `FaultTolerance`:

[source,java]
----
static final FaultTolerance<String> FT1 = FaultTolerance.<String>create()
    .withDescription("ft1")
    .withRetry().maxRetries(3).done()
    .withCircuitBreaker().done()
    .build();

static final FaultTolerance<CompletionStage<String>> FT2 = FaultTolerance.<String>createAsync()
    .withDescription("ft2")
    .withBulkhead().limit(5).queueSize(100).done()
    .withTimeout().duration(3, ChronoUnit.SECONDS).done()
    .build();
----

can be rewritten to:

[source,java]
----
static final Guard GUARD1 = Guard.create()
        .withDescription("ft1")
        .withRetry().maxRetries(3).done()
        .withCircuitBreaker().done()
        .build();

static final Guard GUARD2 = Guard.create()
        .withDescription("ft2")
        .withBulkhead().limit(5).queueSize(100).done()
        .withTimeout().duration(3, ChronoUnit.SECONDS).done()
        .build();
----

Now, as mentioned above, `Guard` is used slightly differently than `FaultTolerance`.
The methods `call()`, `get()`, `adaptCallable()` and `adaptSupplier()` take an extra parameter that expresses the type of the guarded action, again either as a `Class` or as a `TypeLiteral`.

For example, these usages of `FaultTolerance`:

[source,java]
----
String result1 = FT1.call(() -> externalService.hello());
CompletionStage<String> result2 = FT2.get(() -> externalService.helloAsync());

Callable<String> callable = FT1.adaptCallable(
        () -> externalService.hello());
Supplier<CompletionStage<String>> supplier = FT2.adaptSupplier(
        () -> externalService.helloAsync());
----

can be rewritten to:

[source,java]
----
String result1 = GUARD1.call(() -> externalService.hello(), String.class);
CompletionStage<String> result2 = GUARD2.get(() -> externalService.helloAsync(),
        new TypeLiteral<CompletionStage<String>>() {});

Callable<String> callable = GUARD1.adaptCallable(
        () -> externalService.hello(), String.class);
Supplier<CompletionStage<String>> supplier = GUARD2.adaptSupplier(
        () -> externalService.helloAsync(),
        new TypeLiteral<CompletionStage<String>>() {});
----
