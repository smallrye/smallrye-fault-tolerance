= Programmatic API

include::partial$srye-feature.adoc[]

In addition to the declarative, annotation-based API of {microprofile-fault-tolerance}, {smallrye-fault-tolerance} also offers a programmatic API for advanced scenarios.
This API is present in the `io.smallrye:smallrye-fault-tolerance-api` artifact, just like all other additional APIs {smallrye-fault-tolerance} provides.

== Installation

If you use {smallrye-fault-tolerance} as part of a runtime that implements {microprofile-fault-tolerance}, you don't have to do anything.
The programmatic API is ready to use.
In this documentation, we'll call this the _CDI implementation_ of the programmatic API, because it's integrated with the {microprofile-fault-tolerance} implementation, which is naturally based on CDI.

.Quarkus
****
In Quarkus, the {smallrye-fault-tolerance} API is brought in automatically, as a transitive dependency of the Quarkus extension for {smallrye-fault-tolerance}.
That is, you don't need to do anything to be able to use the programmatic API.
****

.WildFly
****
In WildFly, the {smallrye-fault-tolerance} API is not readily available to deployments.
If you want to use it, you need to add a module dependency to the deployment using `jboss-deployment-structure.xml`.

Note that at the time of this writing, the {smallrye-fault-tolerance} module in WildFly is considered private.
If you do add a module dependency on it, to be able to use the {smallrye-fault-tolerance} API, you may be stepping out of the WildFly support scope.
****

In addition to the CDI implementation, {smallrye-fault-tolerance} also offers a _standalone implementation_ that is meant to be used outside of any runtime.
This implementation does not need CDI or anything else.
If you want to use {smallrye-fault-tolerance} in a standalone fashion, just add a dependency on `io.smallrye:smallrye-fault-tolerance-standalone`.
The API is brought in transitively.

== Usage

The entrypoint to the programmatic API is the `FaultTolerance` interface.

This interface represents a configured set of fault tolerance strategies.
Their configuration, order of application and behavior in general corresponds to the declarative API, so if you know that, you'll feel right at home.
If not, the javadoc has all the information you need (though it often points to the annotation-based API for more information).

To create an instance of `FaultTolerance`, you can use the `create` and `createAsync` static methods.
They return a builder which has to be used to add and configure all the fault tolerance strategies that should apply.
There is no external configuration, so all configuration properties have to be set explicitly, using the builder methods.
If you don't set a configuration property, it will default to the same value the annotation-based API uses.

.Disabling Fault Tolerance
****
There's one exception to the "no external configuration" rule.

The CDI implementation looks for the well-known `MP_Fault_Tolerance_NonFallback_Enabled` configuration property in MicroProfile Config.
The standalone implementation looks for a system property with the same name, or obtains the value from custom configuration (as xref:integration/programmatic-api.adoc[described] in the integration section).

If such property exists and is set to `false`, only the fallback and thread offload fault tolerance strategies will be applied.
Everything else will be ignored.

Note that this is somewhat different to the declarative, annotation-based API, where only fallback is retained and the `@Asynchronous` strategy is skipped as well.
Since this significantly changes execution semantics, the programmatic API will apply thread offload even if fault tolerance is disabled.

Similarly to the declarative API, implementations of the programmatic API also read this property only once, when the `FaultTolerance` API is first used.
It is _not_ read again later.
****

Let's take a look at a simple example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyService {
    private static final FaultTolerance<String> guarded = FaultTolerance.<String>create() // <1>
        .withFallback().handler(() -> "fallback").done() // <2>
        .build(); // <3>

    public String hello() throws Exception {
        return guarded.call(() -> externalService.hello()); // <4>
    }
}
----

<1> The `create` invocation typically has to include an explicit type argument (`<String>`).
    The `FaultTolerance` interface has a type parameter which should be set to the return type of the guarded actions.
    This is required to be able to guarantee that a fallback value is of the same type.
<2> The fallback handler may be a simple supplier of the fallback value, or a function that takes the exception and transforms it to the fallback value.
    Here, we use the simpler option.
    Note that we don't set any other configuration options.
    This means that the default set of exceptions is used to determine when fallback should apply.
<3> The `build` method returns a `FaultTolerance<String>` instance, which can later be used to guard arbitrary `String`-returning actions.
<4> Here, we call `externalService.hello()` and guard the call with the previously configured set of fault tolerance strategies.
    (In this case, just fallback.)
    The `call` method uses the `Callable` type to represent the called action.
    Similar methods exist that accept a `Supplier` (`get`) or `Runnable` (`run`).

The previous example shows how to apply fault tolerance to synchronous actions.
{smallrye-fault-tolerance} naturally also supports guarding asynchronous actions, using the `CompletionStage` type.
Unlike the declarative API, the programmatic API doesn't support asynchronous actions that return the `Future` type.

[source,java]
----
public class MyService {
    private static final FaultTolerance<CompletionStage<String>> guarded = FaultTolerance.<String>createAsync() // <1>
        .withBulkhead().done() // <2>
        .withThreadOffload(true) // <3>
        .build();

    public CompletionStage<String> hello() throws Exception {
        return guarded.call(() -> externalService.hello()); // <4>
    }
}
----

<1> The `createAsync` method takes a type parameter of `String` and returns a builder for fault tolerance of type `CompletionStage<String>`.
<2> Here, we add a bulkhead.
    Since we don't configure any property, default values are used.
    That is, at most 10 concurrent executions are permitted, and 10 more executions may be waiting in a queue.
<3> And here, we add a thread offload.
    This is only possible for asynchronous actions, and corresponds to the `@Asynchronous` annotation from {microprofile-fault-tolerance}.
<4> Note that here, unlike the previous example, the `externalService.hello()` method is assumed to return `CompletionStage<String>`.

Asynchronous actions may be blocking or non-blocking.
In the example above, we assume the `externalService.hello()` call is blocking, so we set thread offload to `true`.
{smallrye-fault-tolerance} will automatically move the actual execution of the action to another thread.

If we didn't configure `withThreadOffload`, however, the execution would continue on the original thread.
This is often desired for non-blocking actions, which are very common in modern reactive architectures.

Also note that in this example, we configured multiple fault tolerance strategies: bulkhead and thread offload.
When that happens, the fault tolerance strategies are ordered according to the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification, just like in the declarative API.
Order of all the `with*` method invocations doesnâ€™t matter.

=== Synchronous vs. Asynchronous

What's the difference between `FaultTolerance.<CompletionStage<String>>create()` and `FaultTolerance.<String>createAsync()`?
Both may be used to guard an action that returns `CompletionStage<String>`, correct?

Well, yes and no.

The synchronous variant (created using `create()`) will only guard the synchronous part of the action -- the part that ends by returning the `CompletionStage` instance.
It will _not_ guard the asynchronous behavior.

For example, if an action returns a `CompletionStage` object, synchronous fault tolerance will consider that action successfully finished.
If that `CompletionStage` later completes with an exception, synchronous fault tolerance will never know.
What's more, the fact that this action has already "finished" means that the action will also leave the bulkhead, so concurrency limiting will not work properly.

The asynchronous variant (created using `createAsync()`), on the other hand, will not treat the action as finished until the `CompletionStage` actually completes.
That is, the asynchronous action will only leave the bulkhead when it's complete, so concurrency limiting works as expected.
And if the `CompletionStage` completes exceptionally, asynchronous fault tolerance will treat that as a failure and react accordingly.

To summarize, if you need to guard asynchronous actions, blocking or non-blocking, always use `createAsync`.

=== Single-Action Usage

The `FaultTolerance` API is general and permits guarding multiple different actions using the same set of fault tolerance strategies.
Often, that isn't necessary and we need to guard just a single action, altough possibly several times.

For such use case, the `FaultTolerance` API provides shortcuts that work with the `Callable<T>`, `Supplier<T>` and `Runnable` types.

First off, a `FaultTolerance<T>` instance may be adapted to a `Callable<T>`, `Supplier<T>` or `Runnable` using the `adapt*` methods.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyService {
    private static final FaultTolerance<String> guard = FaultTolerance.<String>create()
        .withTimeout().duration(5, ChronoUnit.SECONDS).done()
        .build(); // <1>

    public String hello() throws Exception {
        Callable<String> callable = guard.adaptCallable(() -> externalService.hello()); // <2>

        return callable.call(); // <3>
    }

}
----

<1> Create a `FaultTolerance<String>` object that can guard arbitrary `String`-returning actions.
<2> Adapt the general `FaultTolerance` instance to a `Callable` that guards the `externalService.hello()` invocation.
    Similar methods exist that accept and return a `Supplier` (`adaptSupplier`) and `Runnable` (`adaptRunnable`).
<3> You can do whatever you wish with the adapted `Callable`.
    Here, we just call it once, which isn't very interesting, but it could possibly be called multiple times, passed to other methods etc.

This style of usage still creates a `FaultTolerance` instance first.
If that is not necessary, you can create a `Callable`, `Supplier` or `Runnable` directly:

[source,java]
----
public class MyService {
    private static final Callable<String> guard = FaultTolerance.createCallable(() -> externalService.hello()) // <1>
        .withTimeout().duration(5, ChronoUnit.SECONDS).done()
        .build();

    public String hello() throws Exception {
        return guard.call(); // <2>
    }
}
----

<1> The `createCallable` method returns a fault tolerance builder that provides the same configuration options, but in the end, returns a `Callable`.
    In this case, a `Callable<String>`.
    These methods typically don't require an explicit type argument, because it can be inferred from the type of action passed in.
    Similar methods exist that return a builder which, in the end, returns a `Supplier` (`createSupplier`) or `Runnable` (`createRunnable`).
<2> Here, we don't have to do anything special, just call the existing `Callable`.
    Again, it could possibly be called multiple times, passed to other methods etc.

=== Stateful Fault Tolerance Strategies

The bulkhead, circuit breaker and rate limit strategies are stateful.
That is, they hold some state required for their correct functioning, such as the number of current executions for bulkhead, the rolling window of successes/failures for circuit breaker, or the time window for rate limit.
If you use these strategies, you have to consider their lifecycle.

The {smallrye-fault-tolerance} programmatic API makes such reasoning pretty straightforward.
Each `FaultTolerance` object has its own instance of each fault tolerance strategy, including the stateful strategies.
If you use a single `FaultTolerance` object for guarding multiple different actions, all those actions will be guarded by the same bulkhead, circuit breaker and/or rate limit.
If, on the other hand, you use different `FaultTolerance` objects for guarding different actions, each action will be guarded by its own bulkhead, circuit breaker and/or rate limit.

If you use the `adapt*` methods, the resulting `Callable`, `Supplier` or `Runnable` objects will guard the underlying action using the original `FaultTolerance` instance, so stateful strategies will be shared.

If you use the `create*` methods that directly return `Callable`, `Supplier` or `Runnable`, each such creation will have its own `FaultTolerance` instance under the hood, so stateful strategies will _not_ be shared.

=== Circuit Breaker Maintenance

The `CircuitBreakerMaintenance` API, accessed through `FaultTolerance.circuitBreakerMaintenance()` or by injection in the CDI implementation, can be used to manipulate all named circuit breakers.
A circuit breaker is given a name by calling `withCircuitBreaker().name("\...")` on the fault tolerance builder, or using the `@CircuitBreakerName` annotation in the declarative API.

Additionally, `CircuitBreakerMaintenance.resetAll()` will also reset all unnamed circuit breakers declared using the `@CicruitBreaker` annotation.
For this to work, all unnamed circuit breakers have to be remembered.
This is safe in case of the declarative, annotation-based API, because the number of such declared circuit breakers is fixed.
At the same time, this would _not_ be safe to do for all unnamed circuit breakers created using the programmatic API, as their number is potentially unbounded.
(In other words, remembering all unnamed circuit breakers created using the programmatic API would easily lead to a memory leak.)

Therefore, all circuit breakers created using the programmatic API must be given a name when `CircuitBreakerMaintenance` is supposed to affect them.
Note that duplicate names are not permitted and lead to an error, so lifecycle of the circuit breaker must be carefully considered.

=== Event Listeners

The programmatic API has one feature that the declarative API doesn't have: ability to observe certain events.
For example, when configuring a circuit breaker, it is possible to register a callback for circuit breaker state changes or for a situation when an open circuit breaker prevents an invocation.
When configuring a timeout, it is possible to register a callback for when the invocation times out, etc. etc.
For example:

[source,java]
----
private static final FaultTolerance<String> guard = FaultTolerance.<String>create()
    .withTimeout().duration(5, ChronoUnit.SECONDS).onTimeout(() -> ...).done() // <1>
    .build();
----

<1> The `onTimeout` method takes a `Runnable` that will later be executed whenever an invocation guarded by `guard` times out.

All event listeners registered like this must run quickly and must not throw exceptions.

=== Summary of `FaultTolerance` Methods

There's a number of static `create*` methods on the `FaultTolerance` interface.
Which one do you want to call depends on the result type of the builder and whether the guarded actions are synchronous or asynchronous.

|===
| The builder result type | Synchronous actions | Asynchronous actions

| `FaultTolerance`
| `create()` -> `FaultTolerance<T>`
| `createAsync()` -> `FaultTolerance<CompletionStage<T>>`

| `Callable`
| `createCallable(Callable<T>)` -> `Callable<T>`
| `createAsyncCallable(Callable<CompletionStage<T>>)` -> `Callable<CompletionStage<T>>`

| `Supplier`
| `createSupplier(Supplier<T>)` -> `Supplier<T>`
| `createAsyncSupplier(Supplier<CompletionStage<T>>)` -> `Supplier<CompletionStage<T>>`

| `Runnable`
| `createRunnable(Runnable)` -> `Runnable`
| `createAsyncRunnable(Runnable)` -> `Runnable`
|===

When you have an instance of `FaultTolerance`, there's also a number of instance methods that either execute an action, or adapt an unguarded action to a guarded one.
Which one do you want to call depends on the type used to represent the action.

|===
| The action type | Execute | Adapt

| `Callable<T>`
| `call(Callable<T>)` -> `T`
| `adaptCallable(Callable<T>)` -> `Callable<T>`

| `Supplier<T>`
| `get(Supplier<T>)` -> `T`
| `adaptSupplier(Supplier<T>)` -> `Supplier<T>`

| `Runnable`
| `run(Runnable)` -> `void`
| `adaptRunnable(Runnable)` -> `Runnable`
|===

== Mutiny Support

In addition to the `FaultTolerance` interface, which provides support for guarding synchronous actions and asynchronous actions using `CompletionStage`, there's a special programmatic API entrypoint for asynchronous actions using the Mutiny library.
It is enough to include the Mutiny support library `io.smallrye:smallrye-fault-tolerance-mutiny`, as described in xref:reference/asynchronous.adoc#async-types[Additional Asynchronous Types].

This entrypoint is called `MutinyFaultTolerance` and it includes static factory methods for creating a `Callable<Uni<T>>`, `Supplier<Uni<T>` and `FaultTolerance<Uni<T>>`.
Guarding a `Multi` is not supported.

These factory methods return the common fault tolerance builder, which is supposed to be used just like the builder used when guarding an async action of type `CompletionStage<T>`.
For example:

[source,java]
----
public class MyService {
    private final Supplier<Uni<String>> guard = MutinyFaultTolerance.createSupplier(() -> externalService.hello()) // <1>
        .withTimeout().duration(5, ChronoUnit.SECONDS).done()
        .withFallback().handler(() -> Uni.createFrom().item("fallback")).done()
        .build();

    public Uni<String> hello() {
        return guard.get();
    }
}
----

<1> The call to `externalService.hello()` is supposed to return `Uni<String>`.

Note that the `Uni` type is lazy, so the action itself won't execute until the guarded `Uni` is subscribed to.

.Quarkus
****
In Quarkus, the Mutiny support library is present by default.
You can use `MutinyFaultTolerance` out of the box.
****

== Configuration

As mentioned above, with the single exception of `MP_Fault_Tolerance_NonFallback_Enabled`, there is no support for external configuration of fault tolerance strategies.
This may change in the future, though possibly only in the CDI implementation.

== Metrics

The programmatic API is integrated with metrics.
All metrics, as described xref:reference/metrics.adoc[in the Metrics reference guide] and the linked guides, are supported.
The only difference is the value of the `method` tag.
With the programmatic API, the `method` tag will be set to the _description_ of the guarded operation, provided on the `FaultTolerance` builder.

[source,java]
----
private static final FaultTolerance<String> guarded = FaultTolerance.<String>create()
    .withDescription("hello") // <1>
    .withFallback().handler(() -> "fallback").done()
    .build();
----

<1> A description of `hello` is set, it will be used as a value of the `method` tag in all metrics.

It is possible to create multiple `FaultTolerance` objects with the same description.
In this case, it won't be possbile to distinguish the different `FaultTolerance` objects in metrics; their values will be aggregated.

If no description is provided, metrics are not emitted.

== Integration Concerns

Integration concerns, which are particularly interesting for users of the standalone implementation, are xref:integration/programmatic-api.adoc[described] in the integration section.
