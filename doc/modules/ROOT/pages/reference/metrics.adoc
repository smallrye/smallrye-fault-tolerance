= Metrics

{smallrye-fault-tolerance} exposes metrics, as {microprofile-fault-tolerance-url}#_integration_with_microprofile_metrics_and_microprofile_telemetry[specified] by {microprofile-fault-tolerance}.

[[general]]
== General Metrics

For all methods guarded with some fault tolerance strategy, the following metric is emitted:

[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Name | `ft.invocations.total`
| Type
a| * MP Metrics: `Counter`
* OpenTelemetry: `LongCounter`
* Micrometer: `Counter`
| Unit | None
| Description | The number of times the method was called.
| Tags
a| * `method` - the fully qualified method name
* `result` = `[valueReturned\|exceptionThrown]` - whether the invocation returned a value or threw an exception
* `fallback` = `[applied\|notApplied\|notDefined]` - `applied` if fallback was used, `notApplied` if a fallback is configured but was not used, `notDefined` if a fallback is not configured
|===

For xref:reference/asynchronous.adoc[asynchronous methods], "value returned" means that the `CompletionStage` completed successfully, while "exception thrown" means that the `CompletionStage` completed exceptionally.

== Specific Metrics

In addition to the general metrics described above, most fault tolerance strategies emit their own metrics.
Those are described in the reference guides:

* xref:reference/bulkhead.adoc#metrics[Bulkhead]
* xref:reference/circuit-breaker.adoc#metrics[Circuit Breaker]
* xref:reference/rate-limit.adoc#metrics[Rate Limit]
* xref:reference/retry.adoc#metrics[Retry]
* xref:reference/timeout.adoc#metrics[Timeout]

== Timer Metrics

For task scheduling purposes (e.g. watching timeouts or delaying retries), {smallrye-fault-tolerance} maintains one thread called the _timer thread_.
Most of the time, it is kept sleeping (parked), it only wakes up (unparks) when necessary to submit tasks to executors.

The behavior of the timer thread can be observed through the following metrics:

[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Name | `ft.timer.scheduled`
| Type
a| * MP Metrics: `Gauge<Integer>`
* OpenTelemetry: `LongUpDownCounter`
* Micrometer: `Gauge`
| Unit | None
| Description | The number of tasks that are currently scheduled (for future execution) on the timer.
| Tags
a| * `id` - the ID of the timer, to distinguish multiple timers in a multi-application environment
|===

== Micrometer Support

In addition to the MicroProfile Metrics and OpenTelemetry support (as specified by {microprofile-fault-tolerance}), {smallrye-fault-tolerance} also provides support for https://micrometer.io/[Micrometer].
The set of metrics emitted to Micrometer is the same, using the same metric names and tags.

Note that distribution summaries in Micrometer, including timers, do not emit quantiles by default.
Micrometer recommends that libraries should not configure them out of the box, so if you need them, you should use a `MeterFilter`.

The following implementation makes sure Micrometer emits the same quantiles as MicroProfile Metrics for all fault tolerance metrics:

[source,java]
----
static final MeterFilter ENABLE_HISTOGRAMS = new MeterFilter() {
    @Override
    public DistributionStatisticConfig configure(Meter.Id id, DistributionStatisticConfig config) {
        if (id.getName().startsWith("ft.")) {
            return DistributionStatisticConfig.builder()
                    .percentiles(0.5, 0.75, 0.95, 0.98, 0.99, 0.999)
                    .build()
                    .merge(config);
        }
        return config;
    }
};
----

== Disabling Metrics

It is possible to completely disable fault tolerance metrics using MicroProfile Config:

[source,properties]
----
MP_Fault_Tolerance_Metrics_Enabled=false
----

It is also possible to disable individual metric providers:

[source,properties]
----
# to disable MP Metrics
smallrye.faulttolerance.mpmetrics.disabled=true

# to disable OpenTelemetry Metrics
smallrye.faulttolerance.opentelemetry.disabled=true

# to disable Micrometer
smallrye.faulttolerance.micrometer.disabled=true
----

This applies when only one metric provider is present as well as when multiple metric providers are present.
