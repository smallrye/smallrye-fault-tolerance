= Bulkhead

For introduction, see xref:howto/bulkhead.adoc[How to Limit Concurrency].

== Description

If a guarded method is called by too many callers concurrently, the excess attempts will fail with `BulkheadException`.

If the guarded method is `@Asynchronous` or `@AsynchronousNonBlocking`, excess attempts are first put into a queue.
The queued attempts are executed later.
When the queue becomes full, excess attempts are rejected with `BulkheadException`.

=== Lifecycle

Bulkhead needs to maintain some state between invocations: the number of current executions and the queue of asynchronous executions.
This state is a singleton, irrespective of the lifecycle of the bean that uses the `@Bulkhead` annotation.

More specifically, the bulkhead state is uniquely identified by the combination of the bean class (`java.lang.Class`) and the method object (`java.lang.reflect.Method`) representing the guarded method.

For example, if thereâ€™s a guarded method `doWork` on a bean which is `@RequestScoped`, each request will have its own instance of the bean, but all invocations of `doWork` will share the same bulkhead state.

[[interactions]]
== Interactions with Other Strategies

See xref:howto/multiple.adoc[How to Use Multiple Strategies] for an overview of how fault tolerance strategies are nested.

If `@Fallback` is used with `@Bulkhead`, the fallback method or handler may be invoked if a `BulkheadException` is thrown, depending on the fallback configuration.

If `@Retry` is used with `@Bulkhead`, each retry attempt is processed by the bulkhead as an independent invocation.
If `BulkheadException` is thrown, the execution may be retried, depending on how retry is configured.

If `@CircuitBreaker` is used with `@Bulkhead`, the circuit breaker is checked before enforcing the concurrency limit.
If concurrency limiting results in `BulkheadException`, this may be counted as a failure, depending on how the circuit breaker is configured.

If `@RateLimit` is used with `@Bulkhead`, the rate limit is enforced before enforcing the concurrency limit.

If `@Timeout` is used with `@Bulkhead`, the timeout watcher is started before enforcing the concurrency limit.

[[configuration]]
== Configuration

There are 2 configuration options, corresponding to the 2 members of the `@Bulkhead` annotation.

=== `value`

Type: `int`

Default: `10`

The concurrency limit.

=== `waitingTaskQueue`

Type: `int`

Default: `10`

The size of queue for excess attempts.
Only effective when the method is `@Asynchronous` or `@AsynchronousNonBlocking`.
See xref:reference/asynchronous.adoc[the Asynchronous Execution reference guide].

[[metrics]]
== Metrics

Bulkhead exposes the following metrics:

[cols="1,5"]
|===
| Name | `ft.bulkhead.calls.total`
| Type
a| * MP Metrics: `Counter`
* OpenTelemetry: `LongCounter`
* Micrometer: `Counter`
| Unit | None
| Description | The number of times the bulkhead logic was run. This is usually once per method call, but may be zero times if the circuit breaker or rate limit prevented execution or more than once if the method call was retried.

a| * `method` - the fully qualified method name
* `bulkheadResult` = `[accepted\|rejected]` - whether the bulkhead allowed the method call to run
